Great Knots (_Calidris tenuirostris_) are small migratory shorebirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway that fly each year between breeding grounds in the eastern Russian Arctic and nonbreeding grounds in Australia. They are also [endangered](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22693359/155482913). One major threat is the habitat destruction and degradation in their stopping areas during their migration.
